Ansible tags are a great feature that help to execute respective tasks from the playbook. 
By default all the tasks from the playbook are executed but with tags we can control this 
behaviour and execute only the tasks with the matching tags.The copy module copies a file 
from the local or remote machine to a location on the remote machine.This project implements 
Ansible tags and copy modules to run specific tasks and copy files from the control node to remote servers.
